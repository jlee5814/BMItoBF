#Description: This program uses python to calculate an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI)
#BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese 
#based on tissue max and height
#A common use of the BMI is to assess how far an individual's body weight departs from what is normal for a person's height
#overweight and obese individuals are at an increased risk for some diseases e.g., sleep apnea, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, stroke, infertility

#Enter weight and height 
weight = float(input("Please enter your weight (lbs): "))
height = float(input("Please enter your height (inches): "))

#Calculate the individual's BMI
h2 = height ** 2 
w = weight
#Calculate the BMI of an individual in U.S. units using the BMI formula
BMI = (w/h2) * 703
BMI = round(BMI, 2)
